Grammar:
ENTRYPOINT -> ...
NT -> Set<u64>(1..3, 50..100, 12) "some text\r\n\"\xXX" other_nonterminal
BIN -> Set<u64>(1..3)
BIN -> Set<u64>(50..100)
BIN -> Set<u64>(12)
OR -> pre-nonterm ("asdf" || "ASDF") post-nonterm
NESTED_OR -> ("x" y z || ("y" || "z" "zz" "zzz") || "third")
CHAR -> 'A' 'B' 'C' '\xXX' # comment
# comment
A -> "a"; B -> "b"; C -> "c"

- non-terminals only [A-Z\-]+

Capabilities:
1. Parse text/binary data into internal representation
2. Generate
3. Mutate
4. Grammar formatter
5. Just translate grammar to C code
6. Merge grammars from different formats / multiple files into one
    - make it so that merge operation is projection and merging
      the same ruleset multiple times is no problem

Interface:
1. Generate C code
2. Rust types to interface with C code
3. LibAFL components that use rust types
